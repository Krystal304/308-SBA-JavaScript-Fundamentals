# Trackit
## This assigment tracker gathers, processes and outputs accurate and current students' grades. This tacker will verify the assignment group matching the correct course if. If the assignment group and course if do not, the program will throw an error. All assignments that are not currently due will not be included in the student's final average. Lastly if the assignment is late, 10% will be automatically deducted from the students' final score.
